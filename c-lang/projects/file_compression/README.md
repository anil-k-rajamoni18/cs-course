### File Compression Tool
This project implements a simple file compression and decompression tool in C. It uses basic frequency counting to compress text files by storing each character and its frequency.

#### Features
- Compress text files by reducing their size.
- Decompress previously compressed files.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

#### How to Use
1. Place the `input.txt` file in the project directory.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
3. Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to compress or decompress files.

### How to Run the File Compression Tool
1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anil-k-rajamoni18/cs-course.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project folder:
   ```
   cd cs-course/c-lang/projects/file_compression
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**: Use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile the source code. Run the following command:
   ```
    gcc file_compression.c -o file_compression
    ```

4. **Run the Executable**: After successful compilation, run the executable to start the File Compression Tool:
    ```
    ./file_compression
    ```

5. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The program will display a menu with various options. Follow the on-screen instructions to compress or decompress files as needed.
