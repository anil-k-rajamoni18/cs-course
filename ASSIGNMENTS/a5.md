1 ans: Here condition is a>5 \
  For a=10 it is true and greater than 5 message will be printed on console\
  But a=3  it is false and no message will be printed on console because there is no statement after IF block.\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int a = 10;\
    if(a % 2 == 0) \{\
        printf("Even\\n");\
    \} else \{\
        printf("Odd\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
2 ans: Here condition is a%2==0\
 For a=10 , 10%2 is 0 I.e it is true so output will be even\
 For a=7,  7%2 is not 0 I.e it is false so output will be odd\
Note\
* else block will execute only if condition in IF block is false\
* if there is no else then the message odd will printed even condition is true or false\
For example a=6 // output is even \
                                                   Odd\
                       a=5 // output is odd(even will not printed since condition is false).\
Q3)\
What grade is printed for marks =70?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int marks = 85;\
    if(marks >= 90) \{\
        printf("A\\n");\
    \} else if(marks >= 75) \{\

    \} else \{\
        printf("C\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}  \
\
3 ans: For marks =85 output will be B\
            For marks =70 output will be C.\
\
Q4)\
What happens if a=-10 and b=5?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int a = 10, b = 5;\
    if(a > 0) \{\
        if(b > 0) \{\
            printf("Both positive\\n");\
        \}\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
 \
4 ans: For a=10, b=5 \
            first complier will check whether a>0 or not since a=10 it is true \
            now complier will check whether b>0 or not since b=5 it is true\
            So output will be Both positive printed on console\
            But for a=-10 since first condition is false complier will not second condition\
            and code will execute successfully \

Q5)\
Predict the output when x=y=30?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int x = 20, y = 30;\
    if(x > y) \{\
        printf("x is greater\\n");\
    \} else \{\
        printf("y is greater\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
5 ans: for x=20 and y=30\
            Here condition x>y is false so output will be y is greater \
            But x=y=30 again x>y is false so output will be y is greater \
            We may think that x and y are equal but programmer didn\'92t written condition \
            For that case \
To get exact answer modified code is \
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int x = 20, y = 30;\
 If (x==y)\
printf(\'93both are equal\'94);\
   else \{\
         if(x > y) \{\
        printf("x is greater\\n");\
        \} \
        else \{\
        printf("y is greater\\n");\
       \}\
      \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
Q6)\
What is printed for a=25,b=25,c=10?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int a = 10, b = 20, c = 15;\
    int max;\
    if(a > b) \{\
        if(a > c) max = a;\
        else max = c;\
    \} else \{\
        if(b > c) max = b;\
        else max = c;\
    \}\
    printf("%d\\n", max);\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
6 ans: For a=10,b=20, c=15  output is 20\
            Because a>b condition is false so complier move to else block here condition is\
            True and max is assigned to b .At last value stored in max is printed   on console.\
             For a= b=25,c=10 output is 25\
             Because similar to case1 a>b is false and condition in else if is true and max is \
             Assigned to b, it is printed on console.  \
\
Q7)\
What is printed if day =5?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int day = 3;\
    switch(day) \{\
        case 1: printf("Mon\\n"); break;\
        case 2: printf("Tue\\n"); break;\
        case 3: printf("Wed\\n"); break;\
        default: printf("Other\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
7 ans: For day =3 complier will check code in case 3 and prints wed on console and stops \
            Due to statement break. We may think what happens break is not there  here other \
            Will also printed on console if break is not written.\
[ Note :1. Break is statement can be used in both loops and switch\
               Its function is terminate loop or switch\
            2. Continue statement can be used in only loops\
                Its function is move to next iteration. ]\
            For day=5 complier move to default and prints other.\

        case 3: printf("Three "); \
        default: printf("Default ");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
8 ans: Here output is Two Three Default\
            Reason-after executing matching case complier directly will fall through \
            Remaining case also to stop this we should use one more statement break\
            After each case so after executing desired case it stops  switch\

            break;\
        default: printf("Default\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
9 ans: for a=1,b=2 output is Inside nested.\
            For a=1,b=3 output is nothing and code will executed . Here complier \
             First check \'93a \'93value  and move desired case i.e case1 and then  checks\
             b value moves to desired case since there is no case3 or default second\
             Will terminated followed by first switch .\

Q10)\
Predict output when x=-5,y=10?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int x = 5, y = 10;\
    if(x > 0 && y > 0) \{\
        printf("Both positive\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
10 ans:for x=5,y=10 output is Both  Positive.since both x>0   and y>0 are true\
             Statement in if block will be executed I.e Both positive  but for x=-5 \
             Since one of the condition is false if block is not executed by default \
             There is no statement after if block code will execute successfully with\
              Printing anything on console.\
[ Note : 1. Here &&, || ,! are three logical operators returns boolean value.\
               2. && returns 1 if both bits are 1 other wise 0.\
               3.  ||  returns 1 if one of bit is 1 other wise 0.\
               4. ! (not logical operator) a unary operator reverse the decision\
                   For example a=9 is true should return 1(since 9 is non zero)\
                   But using !a results 0.]\

    if(x == 0 || y == 0) \{\
        printf("At least one zero\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
11 ans: for x=0,y=1 since one of condition is true I.e x==0 we get output as\
             At least one zero. But x=y=2 as both condition are false if block will\
             Not be executed and there will be no message on console.\

    int a = 10, b = 20;\
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;\
    printf("%d\\n", max);\

\}\
\
12 ans: for a=10,b=20 output is 20 and  for a=30,b=15 output is 30\
             For case1 since a>b is false max will assigned to b ,and it is printed\
             For case 2 since a>b is true max will assigned to a , and it is printed.\
[ Note: 1. E1 ? E2:  E3  this expression is ternary operator which conditional\
                 Statement similar to if else one.\
              2. If E1 is true E2 will be executed and else E3 will be executed .]\

    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
13 ans:This code contains nested conditional statements . First complier\
              Checks x>0 or not since it is true moves to second condition whether\
              y>0 are not as it is false moves to else block and prints Only x positive\

        default: printf("C\\n");\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
15 ans: For grade =85, \
              grade/10 is 8 only not 8.5 since both operands are integers result is\
              Turnated to 8 by complier only.complier moves case 8 and prints B on \
              console as we notice a break statement switch will terminate after case8.\
              Simillarly for grade 95 output is A on console.\

Q16)\
Predict output .why does it print both lines?\

    if(a > 5) \
        printf("Greater "); \
        printf("Check\\n");\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
16 ans: here output is Greater Check will printed on console.\
              When we not use\{\} by default complier will consider below statement \
               As its scope here \'93 printf(\'93Greater \'93);\'94 .and second statement will not\
               depend on if block excites as when code runs .for example a=3 output\
               Is Check only on console.\

Q17)\
Predict output. Explain fall through behaviour?\
\
#include <stdio.h>\
int main() \{\
    int x = 1;\

        case 2: printf("Two "); \
        case 3: printf("Three "); break;\
    \}\
    return 0;\
\}\
\
17 ans: for x=1 desired output is One but here output is One Two Three.\
              This behaviour is known as fall through I.e executing remaining cases \
              After desired case this can be controlled by using break statement after\
              each case.\
[  Note :1. Break is statement can be used in both loops and switch\
               Its function is terminate loop or switch.  ]\
